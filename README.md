## A CNN based classifier to differentiate between rotten and fresh, apples, bananas and oranges.

 This project is a CNN-based fruit freshness classifier that can automatically identify whether a fruit is fresh or rotten. It focuses on three types of fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges.
 The main goal is to help reduce human effort and time in the agricultural industry by using a machine learning model to detect rotten fruits, which, if left unchecked, can spoil fresh ones. 
 The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features from the fruit images and classifies them using a Softmax layer.
 The model was trained on images collected from various sources and achieved an accuracy of 93.78%. It outperformed transfer learning methods in terms of classification performance.
 To use the model, users need to download the required files (static, templates, and app.py), place them in a single folder, and run the application using the command python app.py. 
 Once the server starts, a link will appear in the output, which can be opened in a browser. Users can then upload an image to check whether the fruit is fresh or rotten.
